#SystemC_Implementation_of_a_Digital_Comparator (14-Apr-2014)

A combinational logic circuit. DIGITAL COMPARATORS normally comprise of 3 standard gates i.e. AND, NOR and NOT  gates which compare digital signals at their input terminals and give an output depending on the state and condition of those inputs.

Digital circuits along with the functionality of adding and subtracting binary numbers, they can also compare them and check whether the value at one input is greater or smaller than the value at the second input. Also comparing to see whether the 2 values are equal or not. A DIGITAL COMPARATOR manages to accomplish all these 3 functionalities by using the three gates that work on the principle of Boolean algebra.
